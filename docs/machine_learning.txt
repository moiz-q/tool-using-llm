Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Popular machine learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
