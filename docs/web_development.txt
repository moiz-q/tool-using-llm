Web Development Overview

Web development involves building websites and web applications. It typically consists of two main areas:

Frontend Development: The client-side of web applications, dealing with what users see and interact with. Technologies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Backend Development: The server-side of web applications, handling data storage, business logic, and server configuration. Common languages include Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, and Ruby.

Modern web development often uses frameworks like React, Vue.js, Django, and Express.js to speed up development.
